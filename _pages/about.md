I am a **Full Professor** at the [Computer Science Faculty](https://www.ehu.eus/eu/web/informatika-fakultatea) of the [University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU](http://www.ehu.eus). I am the **director** of the recently created [HiTZ Centre on Language Technology](http://hitz.eus), where I am part of the [Ixa Research Group](http://ixa.eus). I am [Fellow of the ACL](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/acl-fellows-2021), a selective worldwide group of 74 research leaders, and awardee of the [National Research Prize on Informatics](https://www.fbbva.es/premios/premios-investigacion-sociedad-cientifica-informatica-espana-fundacion-bbva-2021/#galardonados) ([video and speech](https://www.fbbva.es/galardonados/eneko-agirre/)). One of my students won the [EurAI Artificial Intelligence PhD Dissertation Award](https://www.eurai.org/award/mikel-artexte).
